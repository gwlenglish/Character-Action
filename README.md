# Character-Action
 Example of a character controller with actions

UnityModel has the example scene. 

Actions are loaded on the CharacterControllerSO. 

 Flow Controls defines which actions are possible (e.g. Combo 1 -> Combo 2). 
 
 Example Character can be found in /UnityModels
 
 Example Actions can be found in CC/Actions
 
 Example Flow Controls can be foudn in CC/ActionFlows
 

Requires Cinemachine to use the Free Look camera. 
Project Settings may need to be adjusted as I created new inputs for Xbox joysticks on the free look camera. 

Project documentation can be found on the pages, uses the docs folder to read html.
