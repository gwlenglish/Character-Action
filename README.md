# Character-Action
 Example of a character controller with actions

UnityModel has the example scene. 

Requires Cinemachine to use the Free Look camera. 
Project Settings may need to be adjusted as I created new inputs for Xbox joysticks on the free look camera. 

Project documentation can be found on the pages, uses the docs folder to read html.
